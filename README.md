SwiftUI and AppKit, **zero third-party dependencies**, no Electron and no telemetry. It also **runs
real Raycast extensions**, rendered as native SwiftUI. Free, open source, and staying that way.

## Features

- **App launcher** — fuzzy-search and launch anything, pin favorites, see what's running, quit an app
  or every app at once.
- **Global hotkey** — one shortcut summons the palette from anywhere.
- **Per-app hotkeys** — bind a key to an app; press it to toggle (focus/hide).
- **Search Files** — open files and folders from the folders you choose, through Spotlight, with no
  index of our own.
- **Dictionary** — look a word up with the Define Word command, or define whatever you typed from the
  launcher's fallbacks, read from the Mac's own dictionaries.
- **Clipboard history** — text and images, searchable, pasted back into the app you were using.
- **Calculator** — do math, unit, live currency and crypto conversions inline, right in the palette.
- **Quicklinks** — turn a URL, search, file or deeplink into a command, with placeholders for typed
  input, the clipboard or the date.
- **Apple Shortcuts** — search and run the shortcuts you built in the Shortcuts app, with aliases and
  global hotkeys.
- **Snippets** — reusable Markdown templates with dynamic placeholders, arguments, nested references
  and optional keyword expansion.
- **Custom commands** — run named shell commands through fuzzy search or their own global hotkeys.
- **Window management** — 34 Rectangle-style actions: halves, quarters, thirds, sizing, nudging,
  display moves, fullscreen and Spaces.
- **System actions** — lock, sleep, restart, empty trash, toggle appearance, Bluetooth, mute, hidden
  files, and more.
- **Calendar and meetings** — your next meeting on the empty palette and in the menu bar, one key to
  join it, or let it join itself.
- **Notes** — an unlimited collection of plain Markdown files in one floating editor, searchable from
  the palette and rendered as you write.
- **Emoji picker** — a searchable emoji grid, one keystroke away.
- **AI chat** — use your own key or an installed AI account: ask Quick AI from the palette, or keep
  longer conversations in the AI Chat window, with a searchable, pinnable history. Off out of the box,
  like every AI feature.
- **Quick Actions** — fix grammar, rewrite, translate or summarize the selected text in any app.
- **Raycast extensions** — run the ones you already have natively, rendered as SwiftUI.
- **Backup and import** — export your settings to a file, or import your setup from Raycast.

## Install

This fork publishes no releases or Homebrew cask. Build it from source on macOS 26+ with Xcode 26 or
newer:

1. Create the `Tinycast Self-Signed` code-signing identity once
   ([docs/signing.md](docs/signing.md), section 1).
2. Clone this repo and run `./Scripts/install-fork.sh`. It builds a signed Release, replaces
   `/Applications/Tinycast.app` and relaunches it.

If the upstream Homebrew cask is installed, remove it first with `brew uninstall --cask tinycast`
(leave off `--zap` to keep your settings and history). The fork build uses the same bundle id, so it
picks up the existing data. The fork build checks this repo for updates, so it never replaces itself
with an upstream release.

## Permissions

**Accessibility** — needed when Tinycast pastes or expands text into another app, and the only
permission snippet keyword expansion needs. You're prompted when you first use a feature that needs
it; grant access in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**. Snippets ship
disabled, and keystrokes are matched locally, never stored and never sent anywhere.

## Using it

1. Open **Settings → General** and record a global shortcut to summon Tinycast.
2. Press it anywhere → the palette floats in. Type to filter, **↵** to launch.
3. **Tab** switches between Apps and Clipboard; **↑/↓** move, **Esc** dismisses.
4. **Settings → Shortcuts** — search an app or custom command and record a global shortcut.
5. **Settings → Snippets** — enable the feature, then create templates with expansion keywords.

## Building from source

See **[docs/development.md](docs/development.md)** for the toolchain, build, packaging, release and
website workflows. **[docs/](docs/README.md)** indexes everything else — architecture, engineering
standards, the design system and one document per feature.
